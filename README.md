 Handy Powershell Scripts and Modules for Windows

## Modules

### `Send-EventLog.psm1`

Import this module into any Windows server or workstation and use the `Send-EventToLog` cmdlet to enter log messages from your scripts and operations into the Windows Event Viewer. Much handier than writing them out to a text file or CSV. Also makes life easier for your teammates or whoever else may come along after you're gone to investigate or troubleshoot some automation you've built.
